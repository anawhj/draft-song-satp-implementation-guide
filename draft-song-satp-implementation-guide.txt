       Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Implementation Guide
              draft-song-satp-implementation-guide-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Implementation
   Guide.  SAT is a protocol operating between two gateways that
   conducts the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another,
   each representing their corresponding digital asset networks.  The
   protocol establishes a secure channel between the endpoints and
   implements a 2-phase commit (2PC) to ensure the properties of
   transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.  The
   implementation guide provides how to design and utilize the SATP
   protocol standards.
