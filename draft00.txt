       Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Implementation Guide
              draft-song-satp-implementation-guide-latest

Abstract

   This memo provides guidelines to developers of gateway systems,
   digital asset networks and client applications for the Secure Asset
   Transfer Protocol (SATP).  Multiple gateways can represent the same
   digital asset network following the SATP standards, which necessitate
   basic implementation guidelines as outlined in this document.  It
   also serves as an introduction to the SATP processing workflow for
   those new to the SATP standards.

   (Note. the initial draft (00) is submitted for a brief review
   regarding the document's direction by SATP WG members during IETF 12
   in Bangkok, Mar 2025)

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes implementation guidance from the perspective
   of developers of peer gateways and digital asset networks.

   The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) facilitates communication
   between peer gateways and other entities such as digital asset
   networks and client applications.  A digital asset network can be
   connected to multiple peer gateways to enable asset transfers while
   ensuring interoperability.  To ensure consistency across multiple
   peer gateways, appropriate guidelines are necessary.

   Peer gateways must implement a secure asset transfer mechanism that
   meets essential requirements related to atomicity, consistency,
   isolation, and durability (ACID).  Security and privacy are also
   critical requirements.  Therefore, this document involves several
   considerations beyond the SATP interface.

   The existing SATP core documents ([SATcore], [SATarch]) provides most
   of the key implementation guidelines, but this document offers a more
   elaborated description of each phase within peer gateways and digital
   asset networks.
